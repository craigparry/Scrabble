board constructor, set up the letter values and frequencies

Todo: 
Need to test the trie on a larger collection of words
so will do that when I get the library of words that I
want to use for the game.

and a io stream to read in frequencies or letter values

need to creat an io stream that reads in the string rep
of a board that can be used to test the legal moves of 
the game 


set up inital board and main game with a toString 
method so that I can test initial set up of the game and 
start preparing the logic of the game.
