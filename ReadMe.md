Scrabble: 


Set up so far the Trie for word lookup. Set up the game 
board constructor, set up the letter values and frequencies 
set up the letter bag. 


Todo: 
Need to test the trie on a larger collection of words
so will do that when I get the library of words that I
want to use for the game tomorrow. 



set up inital board and main game with a toString 
method so that I can test initial set up of the game and 
start preparing the logic of the game.
